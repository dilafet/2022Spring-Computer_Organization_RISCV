# 2022Spring Computer Organization - RISC-V Pipelined CPU on FPGA

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a pipelined RISC-V CPU on an FPGA using Verilog. The project focuses on designing and constructing an optimized datapath with minimal stalling to enhance performance. Additionally, advanced techniques such as forwarding and conditional branch execution in the pipeline are implemented to reduce delays.

## Features

- **Pipelined RISC-V CPU:** Implementation of a pipelined CPU architecture for RISC-V instruction set.
- **Optimized Datapath:** Design and construction of a datapath optimized for minimal stalling, thereby enhancing overall performance.
- **Forwarding:** Implementation of forwarding techniques to efficiently handle data hazards and reduce pipeline stalls.
- **Conditional Branch Execution:** Advanced techniques for advancing conditional branch execution in the pipeline to minimize delays.
- **UART Integration:** Development and integration of simple I/O with UART for communication.
